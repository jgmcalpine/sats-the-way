MVP TODO:
- Define the structure of the Events we will use
    - Create a custom event kind
    - Decide how to standardize data formatting to be read for our purposes
    - How to handle gating content?
- Allow users to connect through NIP-07
- Allow users to make an NWC connection in the flow of the book
- Query for and display available books
- Allow authors to submit books as events
    - They should be able to set paywalls and collect directly when users pay them
    - Are they meant to write on our platform? Or just upload a book? How would they save their work?
- Create a bespoke relay to store these specific events? Probably want to store profile events too

NICE TO HAVES:
- Allow authors to submit images
