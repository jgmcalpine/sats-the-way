# Sats the way

Build your own adventure - digital choose-your-own-adventure books that are free to start and cost small amounts to make choices at forks in the road.

## Overview
Built during the Bitcoin 2025 Official Hackathon, Sats the Way allows authors to distribute their writing and interact with their readers in novel ways. With digital-first content, books can be interactive in ways never before possible while ensuring creators are rewarded for their work.

Sats the Way is a platform for creating and enjoying choose-your-own-adventure style digital books. Authors are able to upload their writing, including images or other media, and set paywalls to charge small amounts for users to choose their path in the story. Readers are able to search for books, start them for free, and decide to pay if they wish to continue reading. The funds go directly from reader to author.
